## Initiation

## The Data

* #### Raw data can be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2

* #### The data is processed using the same data processing method for my Reproducible Research project

```{r, cache = TRUE}
processed_data <- read.csv("Data/data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(processed_data)
```
