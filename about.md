#### About the application

This application helps us analyse the impact of severe weather events on the economy and the population in the United States from 1996 to 2011. 

#### About the data

This application utilises data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. The raw data can be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2. It is processed using the same data processing method for my Reproducible Research project. Please contact me at: yichenliu@outlook.com for a copy of the data processing code.

#### How to use

To start using the application, please click on the `Analysis` tab at the top of the page. The main selection panel, which is located on the left hand side of the `Analysis` page, lists selection options for Year (from 1996 to 2011), Events Type (Drought, Flood, Hail, etc.) and Region (Central, Mid-Atlantic, North-East, etc.). You can analyse the impact of severe weather events on either the economy or the population by clicking on the sub-tabs (`Economic Impact` or `Population Impact`) next to the main selection panel. Under each of the sub-tab, you have the option to select the impact measurement. The results, which are based on your selections, will be produced into a series of charts under the measurement selection panel.
